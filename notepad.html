Another busy week and my midterm exam is on Monday. I feel stressed out.

<time>2025-04-13T13:42:00+0800</time>
Today I successfully logged in Minecraft! I just can't do it yesterday.
Actually this is my second time disconnect from Minecraft. The first time happened on last year and it lasted 2 weeks.

This week I'm too busy to play my computer, but I found that there were 2 easter egg in A Minecraft Movie.
Neither my classmate nor I found the second one, but I saw it on Bilibili.
Also, I have found a video maker called <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3461563763656906">开朗SU</a> on Bilibili who has 147k followers.
Luckily, he is a middle school student just like me so I'm planning to cooperate with him.

Well my skin still can't be shown in the game even the session server is on.
Now I use the mirror session server provided by <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/4690315">Fallen_Breath</a> (original article <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1042175188776517638">here</a>).
The Essential Network is still offline. I'll try to disable it later.

I got the cape this morning, but I can't find it in the dressing room in Bedrock or in the skins menu in the Launcher.
Also, the Essential mod can't connect to the server even if I refreshes my VPN several times, so now I can't get my skin shown.
It seems that the Minecraft session server is not reachable. Now I have no idea about it.

I went to see A Minecraft Movie today with one of my classmates and I really enjoyed it.
It was a bit wierd at first, but the later story was fascinating.
However, I haven't got the <a href="https://namemc.com/cape/764e20cd7392bc24">Yearn cape</a> yet, so I have to hurry up.

This is a notepad for me to write down my thoughts, ideas, plans, etc. (approximately equivalent to <a href="https://x.com">X</a>).
It is not meant to be a blog or a diary, but rather a place for me to jot down things that I want to remember or work on later.
Now this is my first note.
