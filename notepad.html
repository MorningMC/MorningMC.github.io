				My friends tell me that laptops can't change GPU...
				Perhaps I need to buy a new laptop or just use the laptop that I'm working on.
				However, hard disk seems not to be a problem.

				I'm ready to install Arch Linux on my PC (actually EndeavourOS) alongside Windows.
				Perhaps before installing, I need to replace my GPU and hard disk since my GPU is too old to play Minecraft,
				and my hard disk is too small to install both Windows and Linux.
				Another thing is that I found myself possibly stuck in the "2-week Minecraft phase," which I once thought I would never experience.
				And also, I have got the license to use <i>Untitled Memories</i>, which will be used as the theme song of <i>United Era</i>.

				I have been finding for a Minecraft Boston map on the Internet for almost half a day, but I found nothing except single buildings.
				The BTE team only built a little bit of Boston, and that's far not enough.
				The map is required in the <i>United Era</i> since the story happened in Boston in 2023.
				I have asked AIs and my friends for help, but none of them gave me a satisfying answer.

				The physics class a few days ago got me thinking:
				since particles are manifestations of wave function collapse, and particle mass can be converted into energy,
				is it possible that particles are actually macro manifestations of energy aggregation?

				Happy Children's Day!
				The good news is that I got a place in an international high school.
				But I'm required to speak English there. I can't imagine what my videos will be like!
				Also, my new MCIM series <i>United Era</i> will be on summer vacation.
				It is based on Loop Index by our old friend <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/159146024">OxygenNineIsHere</a>.
				Furthermore, I made a logo for myself and the new series.
				I am considering setting my logo as this site's new background.
				In addition, I installed BTop on my computer. It's cool.

				Today is my school trip, but I didn't go because I think it is boring.
				But I am wrong — my mom asks me to do my homework all day, and that's much worse than going on the trip.
				And finally, I just restarted my computer and I found that vmmemCmZygote seems to be gone.
				Maybe I wouldn't need to reinstall Windows?
				Also, I'm currently working on customizing fastfetch, and it was a bit tricky.
				The last thing is that I was currently watching <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/159146024">OxygenNineIsHere</a>'s video on MCIM.
				I think MCIM is a great direction to make videos since it is interesting and there are only a few UPs making videos on it in China.

				I just remade my meta.png (Yeah, the cover but renamed) and my meta (outro) animation, and it looks much better than the last one.
				I'm considering making the meta as this website's background.
				Also, my school trip will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday.

				Well, I finished my banner (or should I say, cover?), and it looks good.
				I even made an outro animation for my coming videos.
				However, the greenscreen effect does not look well, and I have to think of a way to deal with it.
				Also, I installed a free version of <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">DaVinci Resolve</a> to edit my videos
				instead of CapCut since it can only export 5-min videos and have limited functions without paying.
				I haven't used it yet, but I think it will be a good choice.

				Happy Labor's Day!
				The bad news is that my school trip was delayed indefinitely.
				As for vmmemCmZygote, I think I have to reinstall Windows without losing my data (Update mode?) since it may be in the kernel of the system.
				I can't even stop it by WMIC!
				If that doesn't work, I will post a question on <a href="https://zhihu.com">Zhihu</a>.
				Currently, I'm focusing on making a new banner for my videos. Hope I can finish it soon.

				I found something hidden in my PC.
				When I first bought this PC, I could play Minecraft fluency with about 200 FPS and 60+ FPS with shaders.
				But for a long time afterward, I found that the FPS dropped to about 30 FPS and only 5 FPS with shaders.
				Once I was surfing in <a href="https://bilibili.com">Bilibili</a>, I found a video that shows the same problem on my PC, but I cant find it now.
				It shows the problem is caused by an unknown virus, which can be stopped automatically when the user opens the Task Manager.
				Then I noticed that the second I opened Task Manager, the GPU usage dropped from 100% to 3% ~ 7%.
				This week if found an unknown process called vmmemCmZygote, run by an unknown user (System user? Placeholder? I don't know) 29F14B64-39D6-49D1-9AF0-F7E4FCD810D.
				I'm pretty sure that this is the cause of the problem, since I have no access to this process and I can't stop it even if I force to stop it using PowerShell in admin mode.
				I can't even find the location of this process and the unknown user who runs it.
				If I check the property of this process, it shows the property of the Documents folder.
				I have no idea about it. I will post a question on <a href="https://zhihu.com">Zhihu</a> later if I can't deal with it.

				Finally, I finished my midterm exam! I think I did well and I have a lot to share.
				First, I wrote an unconventional English composition. I took this composition to my English teacher, and she was unable to give a score.
				The second is that I will have a school trip on Sunday and Monday. That seems fun, but I don't think it's not particularly fun.
				Third, I made a custom loading screen when my computer was booting up through <a href="https://github.com/Metabolix/HackBGRT">HackBGRT</a>.
				Though It's cool, It still has some bugs.
				The last is that I'm going to build a mail server since I saw a bunch of devs doing this. But still, it is just a crazy thought.

				Actually, this is my second time disconnecting from Minecraft. The first time happened last year, and it

				This week I'm too busy to play my computer, but I found that there were two Easter eggs in <i>A Minecraft Movie</i>.
				Neither my classmate nor I found the second one, but I saw it on Bilibili.
				Also, I have found a video maker called <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3461563763656906">开朗SU</a>on Bilibili who has 147k followers.
				Luckily, he is a middle school student just like me, so I'm planning to cooperate with him.

				Well, my skin still can't be shown in the game even if the session server is on.
				Now I use the mirror session server provided by <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/4690315">Fallen_Breath</a>
				(original article <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1042175188776517638">here</a>).
				The Essential Network is still offline. I'll try to disable it later.

				I got the cape this morning, but I can't find it in the dressing room in Bedrock or in the skins menu in the Launcher.
				Also, the Essential mod can't connect to the server even if I refresh my VPN several times, so now I can't get my skin shown.
				It seems that the Minecraft session server is not reachable. Now I have no idea about it.

				I went to see <i>A Minecraft Movie</i> today with one of my classmates, and I really enjoyed it.
				It was a bit weird at first, but the later story was fascinating.
				However, I haven't got the <a href="https://namemc.com/cape/764e20cd7392bc24">Yearn cape</a> yet, so I have to hurry up.

				This is a notepad for me to write down my thoughts, ideas, plans, etc. (approximately equivalent to <a href="https://x.com">X</a>).
				It is not meant to be a blog or a diary, but rather a place for me to jot down things that I want to remember or work on later.
				Now this is my first note.
