I found something hidden in my PC.
When I first bought this PC, I can play Minecraft fluency with about 200 FPS and 60+ FPS with shaders.
But for a long time afterwards, I found that the FPS dropped to about 30 FPS and only 5 FPS with shaders.
Once I was surfing in <a href="https://bilibili.com">Bilibili</a>, I found a video that shows the same problem on my PC, but I cant find it now.
It shows the problem is caused by an unknown virus, which can be stopped automatically whe the user opens Task Manager.
Then I noticed that the second I opened Task Manager, the GPU usage dropped from 100% to 3% ~ 7%.
This week if found an unknown process called vmmemCmZygote, run by an unknown user (System user? Placeholder? I don't know) 29F14B64-39D6-49D1-9AF0-F7E4FCD810D.
I'm pretty sure that this is the cause of the problem, since I have no access to this process and I can't stop it even if I force stop it using PowerShell in admin mode.
I can't even find the location of this process and the unknown user who runs it.
If i check the property of this process, it shows the property of Documents folder.
I have no idea about it. I will post a question on <a href="https://zhihu.com">Zhihu</a> later if I can't deal with it.

Finally I finished my midterm exam! I think I did well and I have a lot to share.
First, I wrote an unconventional English composition. I took this composition to my English teacher and she was unable to give a score.
Second is that I will have a school trip on Sunday and Monday. That seems to be fun, but I don't think it's not particularly fun.
Third, I made a custom loading screen when my computer is booting up through <a href="https://github.com/Metabolix/HackBGRT">HackBGRT</a>.
Though It's cool, It still have some bugs.
The last is that I'm going to build a mail server since I saw a bunch of devs doing this. But still, it is just a crazy thought.

Another busy week and my midterm exam is on Monday. I feel stressed out.

Today I successfully logged in Minecraft! I just can't do it yesterday.
Actually this is my second time disconnect from Minecraft. The first time happened on last year and it lasted 2 weeks.

This week I'm too busy to play my computer, but I found that there were 2 easter egg in A Minecraft Movie.
Neither my classmate nor I found the second one, but I saw it on Bilibili.
Also, I have found a video maker called <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/3461563763656906">开朗SU</a> on Bilibili who has 147k followers.
Luckily, he is a middle school student just like me so I'm planning to cooperate with him.

Well my skin still can't be shown in the game even the session server is on.
Now I use the mirror session server provided by <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/4690315">Fallen_Breath</a> (original article <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1042175188776517638">here</a>).
The Essential Network is still offline. I'll try to disable it later.

I got the cape this morning, but I can't find it in the dressing room in Bedrock or in the skins menu in the Launcher.
Also, the Essential mod can't connect to the server even if I refreshes my VPN several times, so now I can't get my skin shown.
It seems that the Minecraft session server is not reachable. Now I have no idea about it.

I went to see A Minecraft Movie today with one of my classmates and I really enjoyed it.
It was a bit wierd at first, but the later story was fascinating.
However, I haven't got the <a href="https://namemc.com/cape/764e20cd7392bc24">Yearn cape</a> yet, so I have to hurry up.

This is a notepad for me to write down my thoughts, ideas, plans, etc. (approximately equivalent to <a href="https://x.com">X</a>).
It is not meant to be a blog or a diary, but rather a place for me to jot down things that I want to remember or work on later.
Now this is my first note.
