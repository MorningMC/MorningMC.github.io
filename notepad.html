I went to see A Minecraft Movie today with one of my classmates and I really enjoyed it.
It was a bit wierd at first, but the later stories is fascinating.
However, I haven't got the <a href="https://namemc.com/cape/764e20cd7392bc24">Yearn cape</a> yet, so I have to hurry up.

This is a notepad for me to write down my thoughts, ideas, plans, etc. (approximately equivalent to <a href="https://x.com">X</a>).
It is not meant to be a blog or a diary, but rather a place for me to jot down things that I want to remember or work on later.
Now this is my first note.
